MobileNetV2 is very similar to the original MobileNet, except that it uses inverted residual blocks with bottlenecking features. It has a drastically lower parameter count than the original MobileNet. MobileNets support any input size greater than 32 x 32, with larger image sizes offering better performance.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to classify images using transfer learning and adjusting the MobileNetV2 architecture.

<br/>

The tutorial is divided into 3 parts:

Part 1: prepare your image dataset. 

Part 2: Build the model based on  MobileNet-V2 and transfer learning (adjust the last layers to our needs), and train it 

part 3 : Test the model on a new fresh image
