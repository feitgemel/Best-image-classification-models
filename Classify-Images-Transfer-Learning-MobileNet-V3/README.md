In this tutorial, we will learn how to classify images using transfer learning and adjusting the MobileNetV3 architecture to our dataset 

We will classify 9 types of fish.

<br/>

The tutorial is divided into 3 parts:

Part 1: prepare your image dataset. 

Part 2: Build the model based on  MobileNet-V3 and transfer learning (adjust the last layers to our needs), and train it 

part 3 : Test the model on a new fresh image
