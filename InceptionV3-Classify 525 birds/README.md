Welcome to our tutorial on transfer learning using InceptionV3 with TensorFlow! 
We will classify more than 500 birds classes 
In this video, we'll guide you through the entire process of preparing your data, building the model, and testing its performance.

<br/>
🔍 Data Preparation: We'll start by preparing the train , test and validation images folders.

🛠️ Model Building with TensorFlow Keras: Next, we'll dive into the implementation of InceptionV3 architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API. You'll learn how to configure and fine-tune the pre-trained model for your specific task.

📊 Testing the Model: Once the model is trained, we'll show you how to test the model using a new and fresh image
