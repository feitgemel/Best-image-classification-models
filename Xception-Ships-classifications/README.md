In this tutorial, I’ll walk you step by step through building a ship classification model using Xception, one of the most powerful deep learning architectures available.

We’ll cover everything from loading and preprocessing data, to one-hot encoding labels, augmenting images, and finally training a custom deep learning model.
By the end, you’ll know how to train, evaluate, and deploy an image classifier that can predict ship categories like Cargo, Military, Carrier, Cruise, and Tankers.


<br/>

You’ll learn how to:

✅ Installation 

✅ Load and preprocess the data 

✅ Build , train , evaluate the model  

✅ Running inference on test image
