Ever wondered how AI can instantly recognize what’s inside an image? 🚀
In this Python tutorial, we’ll show you exactly how to build a powerful image classification model using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and TensorFlow Lite’s EfficientNet.


<br/>

You’ll learn how to:
✅ How to read and display images with OpenCV.
✅ How to set up a MediaPipe Image Classifier from scratch.
✅ How to use EfficientNet Lite for fast and accurate predictions.
✅ How to overlay results directly on your image with OpenCV.
