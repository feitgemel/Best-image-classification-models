In this tutorial, we dive into the world of image classification using YOLOv8 and PyTorch. 

Learn how to train YOLOv8 on a custom dataset, leveraging the power of Ultralytics' implementation on GitHub. From understanding the basics to advanced techniques, we cover everything from setting up YOLOv8 PyTorch environment to testing the model on your own images.


<br/>

This tutorial has 4 parts : 

🔍 Download and prepare the data : We'll start by downloading the images, and preparing the dataset for the train

🐍 Create Conda enviroment and all the relevant Python libraries .

🛠️ Training : Run the train over our dataset

📊 Testing the Model: Once the model is trained, we'll show you how to test the model using a new and fresh image
