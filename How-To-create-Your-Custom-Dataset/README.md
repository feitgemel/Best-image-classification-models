Want high-quality training images without scraping for hours?
In this hands-on Python tutorial, we use Hugging Face Diffusers and Stable Diffusion to generate synthetic images for image classification.

<br/>

First, we load the pipeline and validate a baseline prompt.
Then we dial in the key parameters—num_inference_steps, fixed height/width for consistent inputs, num_images_per_prompt for variety, and a negative_prompt to cut blur and artifacts.
Finally, we scale the exact same technique to batch-generate labeled images by class and organize them into folders—ready for your training loop.
You’ll leave with a reproducible recipe to create clean, class-balanced datasets entirely in Python.
