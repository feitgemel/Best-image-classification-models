In this tutorial, we’ll build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Python and TensorFlow to classify 30 different musical instrument classes..

<br/>
🔍 Data Preparation: We'll start by preparing the train , test and validation images folders.

🛠️ Model Building with TensorFlow Keras: Next, we'll dive into the implementation of CNN architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API.

📊 Testing the Model: Once the model is trained, we'll show you how to test the model using a new and fresh images
