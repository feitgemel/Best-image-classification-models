Welcome to our tutorial on transfer learning using VGG19 with TensorFlow and Keras! 
We will train and classify Aircrafts images
In this video, we'll guide you through the entire process of preparing your data, building the model, and testing its performance.

<br/>
🔍 Data Preparation: We'll start by downloading the images dataset.

🛠️ Model Building with TensorFlow Keras: Next, we'll dive into the implementation of VGG19 architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API. You'll learn how to configure and fine-tune the pre-trained model for your specific task.

📊 Testing the Model: Once the model is trained, we'll show you how to test the model using a new and fresh image
